# ðŸ”­ About Me
-->
Hi, I'm **Nguyá»…n DÆ°Æ¡ng Thuáº­n**, a university student currently learning software engineer. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy building projects that help me practice and improve my coding skills. Although I'm still a beginner, I am committed to learning new things every day and continuously developing my skills in web technologies.

## ðŸŒ± My Journey

I've recently started my journey into web development, and I'm always excited to explore new programming languages and frameworks. Through various projects, I'm gradually building a solid foundation in creating websites and applications.

## âš¡ Projects

I enjoy working on small personal projects to apply what Iâ€™ve learned. You can check out my repositories here on GitHub to see what Iâ€™ve been working on. Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in collaborating or sharing knowledge!
